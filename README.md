Color codes:  
* White - Walkable area  
* Grey - Non-walkable area  
* Red - Bookcase  
* Beige - Bookcase (which doesn't contain a book or manuscript)  
* Cyan/Orange - Mapped book  
* Blue - Mapped dark manuscript  
* Yellow - Hint, there is likely a book or manuscript in the bookcase

Controls:  
* Map a book by left-clicking on a bookcase and then on the book name.  
* Unmap a book by right-cliking on the book name or right-clicking on the bookcase.  
* Toggle the color of the book by clicking on the book name, which is useful if you're trying to keep track of which books you have and which ones you don't have.  
* As books are mapped, a code will be generated. It can be copy and pasted between devices to copy all book mappings.  
* If you wish to reset everything, reload the page.

How to use:  
Start by finding any book or manuscript. Map it in the tool by left-clicking on a red dot and then left-clicking on the book name. The tool will then display yellow dots on all bookcases which have books in them, and from here on you only need to search those. Some of them will be wrong, but as you map more and more books, the amount of wrong ones will decrease. Note that they can also mark dark manuscripts, however there are 10 different ones, and you are only able to find 1 of them at a time.  
I would recommend that you start by searching either all floors in NW or all floors in NE to reduce the amount of wrong yellow dots. The top floor in the southwest room has some weird mechanics and doesn't provide as useful information as the other rooms, so you typically don't want to start by searching in that one.  
Using this method you can find the location of all books (and most of the manuscripts) in ~6 minutes with only one account.  
Note: All books move every 60-90(?) minutes, which means you'll have to restart whenever that happens.
